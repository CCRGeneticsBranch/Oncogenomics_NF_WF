## Introduction


This bioinformatics pipeline is **containerized** and **platform-independent**, built using a **Nextflow DSL2** workflow, and deployed on both the NIH **Biowulf HPC cluster** and the **AWS cloud**.  

This **Exomeâ€“RNA-seq workflow** accepts a samplesheet and FASTQ files as input, then performs a comprehensive set of analyses, including:  

- Extensive quality control  
- Mutation calling  
- Tumor mutational burden assessment  
- Mutational signature analysis  
- HLA typing  
- Copy-number variation detection  
- T-cell infiltration prediction  
- Neoantigen prediction  
- Gene expression profiling  
- Fusion detection  
- Variant calling and annotation  

This end-to-end suite supports **deep genomic characterization** for both research and institutional datasets at NIH.  

Results can be explored via the [ClinOmics Data Portal](https://oncogenomics.ccr.cancer.gov/production/public/), which provides a secure, interactive, user friendly web interface for data visualization and interpretation. It is well suited for both individual patient level and cohort wide cancer genomics analysis.


### Who This Is For
This workflow is intended for researchers and bioinformaticians working with exome and RNA-seq datasets who need a reproducible, scalable, and validated solution for comprehensive genomic analysis. It is designed for use in both **HPC** and **cloud computing** environments.  


Here is a Snapshot of our RNAseq and Exome workflows.

## Prerequisites

To run this workflow, you will need the following software:

```
	Nextflow >= 21.04.3
	Singularity 3.10.5
	Graphviz 2.40
```

## Installation

Please clone this repository to your local filesystem using the following command:

```
        git clone https://github.com/CCRGeneticsBranch/Oncogenomics_NF_WF.git
        cd Oncogenomics_NF_WF
```

## Setting up the workflow on biowulf

1. This workflow is hosted on biowulf in khanlab space `/data/khanlab/projects/Nextflow_dev/dev/AWS_POC_MVP_NF`.
2. All the pipeline config can be accessed using `/data/khanlab/projects/Nextflow_dev/dev/AWS_POC_MVP_NF/nextflow.config` file.
3. Within the nextflow.config file you can select the profile to launch the pipeline.`biowulf` profile is preselected in the `nf.sh` script. This is set up to work with biowulf batch resources.
4. Guidelines to create an input samplesheet can be found [here](samplesheet.md).
5. All the references, annotation and bed files are currently located under `/data/khanlab`. We currently support data processing for these capture kits.
